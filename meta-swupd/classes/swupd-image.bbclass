# Class for swupd integration -- generates input artefacts for consumption by
# swupd-server and calls swupd-server to process the inputs into update
# artefacts for consumption by swupd-client.
#
# Usage:
# * inherit this class in your core OS image. swupd-based OS's use bundles, the
#   primary one of which, os-core, is defined as the contents of this image.
# * Assign a list of names for bundles you wish to generate to the
#   SWUPD_BUNDLES variable i.e. SWUPD_BUNDLES = "feature_one feature_two"
# * Assign a list of packages for which their content should be included in
#   a bundle to a varflag of BUNDLE_CONTENTS which matches the bundle name
#   i.e. BUNDLE_CONTENTS[feature_one] = "package_one package_three package_six"
# * Ensure the OS_VERSION variable is assigned an integer value and increased
#   before each image build which should generate swupd update artefacts.
#
# See docs/Guide.md for more information.

# Created for each bundle (including os-core) and the "full" directory,
# describing files and directories that swupd-server needs to include in the update
# mechanism (i.e. without SWUPD_FILE_BLACKLIST entries). Used by swupd-server.
SWUPD_ROOTFS_MANIFEST_SUFFIX = ".content.txt"
# Additional entries which need to be in images (for example, /etc/machine-id, but
# that are excluded from the update mechanism. Ignored by swupd-server,
# used by swupdimage.bbclass.
SWUPD_IMAGE_MANIFEST_SUFFIX = ".extra-content.txt"

# Name of the base image. Always set, constant (unlike PN, which is
# different in the different virtual images).
SWUPD_IMAGE_PN = "${@ d.getVar('PN_BASE', True) or d.getVar('PN', True)}"

# Main directory in which swupd is invoked. The actual output which needs
# to be published will be in the "www" sub-directory.
DEPLOY_DIR_SWUPD = "${DEPLOY_DIR}/swupd/${MACHINE}/${SWUPD_IMAGE_PN}"

# The "format" needs to be bumped for different reasons:
# - the output of the swupd-server changes in a way that
#   a swupd-client currently installed on devices  will not
#   understand it (example: changing file names or using
#   a new compression method for archives)
# - the content of the distro changes such that a device
#   cannot update directly to the latest build (example:
#   the distro changes the boot loader and some swupd postinst
#   helper which knows about that change must be installed on
#   the device first before actually switching)
#
# meta-swupd handles the first case with SWUPD_TOOLS_FORMAT.
# The default value matches the default versions of the swupd-server
# and swupd-client. Distros can override this if they need to pick
# non-default versions of the tools, but that is not tested.
#
# Distros need to handle the second case by preparing and releasing
# a build that devices can update to (i.e. the version URL the devices
# check must have that update), then make the incompatible change and
# in the next build bump the SWUPD_DISTRO_FORMAT.
#
# In both cases, SWUPD_FORMAT gets bumped. meta-swupd notices that
# and then prepares a special transitional update:
# - the rootfs is configured to use the new SWUUPD_FORMAT and
#   OS_VERSION
# - a fake OS_VERSION-1 release is built using a swupd-server that is
#   compatible with the swupd-client before the bump
# - the OS_VERSION release then is the first one using the new format
#
# This way, devices are forced to update to OS_VERSION-1 because that
# will forever be the "latest" version for their current format.
# Once they have updated, the device really is on OS_VERSION, configured
# to use the new format, and the next update check will see future
# releases again.
#
# For this to work, "swupd-client" should always be invoked without
# explicit format parameter.

# The information about where to find version information and actual
# content is needed in several places:
